-- | This module defines a high-level intermediate representation;
-- at this point we fork off between high-level targets like lurk
-- and pluts, and lower-level, machine-like targets.
--
-- The high-level IR is recognizably lambda calculus. Noteworthy
-- properties include:
--
-- * Everything is still in ANF
-- * Lambdas have explicit capture lists (this will help when
--   translating to low level IRs, and may help optimize
--   serialization on plutus; see detailed discussion below).
-- * All side effects happen in an explicit effect monad, chained
--   together with a monadic bind operator. Most high level
--   constructs in Glow with simple operational semantics
--   still exist as primitives at this level (e.g.Â ADTs/match,
--   tuples, if/else, etc).
-- * The IR is not type checked. Down the line, we will likely
--   introduce a typed variant, but we leave this for future work.
